  bio: "Leveraging a robust background as a Full-Stack Developer, I am transitioning into AI Research and Engineering to build the next generation of intelligent software systems. As a Developer and IT Instructor at Win Academy Dadu, I have mastered the engineering lifecycle by building full-stack web applications and teaching core computational concepts in Java, C++, and Python. This experience provides me with the unique ability to not only design AI models but to integrate them into responsive, user-centric platforms. My journey into AI began at Elevvo Pathways, where I collaborated on Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects, applying my programming expertise to solve complex language-based challenges. Currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science at Sukkur IBA University, I am Certified in Ethical Hacking by Cisco. I integrate this security mindset with my full-stack and AI skills to ensure that the intelligent systems I build are not only innovative but also secure and reliable. Driven by a passion for both teaching and problem-solving, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical AI research and practical, deployed engineering solutions.",
